# Data-Pointer-Swap

Simple Kernel Mode Data Pointer Swap, Credits To FoxiTV On UC for Great Resources About This Topic.
This Source Was Made Back In August 2021 & Decided To Release This Now As I Never Had A Purpose To Use This At All. 
I Know There Is Alot Info Already But Why Not Add Some More Pasta To My GitHub.

Some Info About This Driver:
Status Would Be 100% Detected As Im Probaly Using A Popular Pointer & Not Doing Any Pointer Chaining. (or other methods)
I Suggest Finding A Random non-PG Protected Module And Take Advantage Of That.
